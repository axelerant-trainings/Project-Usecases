## Description:
Enhance the mobile application functionality to now allow users to securely review and delete their own articles. This feature requires the development or enhancement of an OAuth-secured API endpoint that supports deletion operations while ensuring robust security.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- The system uses OAuth to authenticate users
- The system verifies that the authenticated user has the appropriate role and permissions to delete the article
- All deletion operations must be logged with sufficient details
