# API Rate Limiting Implementation

## Description:
To protect our public API endpoints from abuse and ensure fair usage, implement rate limiting based on an IP address or API key, with configurable limits.

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Rate limiting applies to all public-facing API endpoints.
- Configurable limits per minute per IP/API key.
- Respond with a 429 status code when the limit is exceeded.
- Provide clear error messages indicating the rate limit is exceeded and the time until reset.
